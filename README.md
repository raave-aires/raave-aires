# Hi there! 🤙 I'm Raavë.
I, Raave, am a young brazilian 🇧🇷 Front-End developer. And I'm passionate about JavaScript and glassmorphism.

## 🧔🏻‍♂️ More about me:
- 🧡 I love the Front-end! Probably because I like to see plans growing and becoming real, and in the Front-End this is so much more tangible, but anyway...
- 🔭 I like to explore technologies and learn new things, but for now I'm focused on studying and improving myself for Front-End positions.
- ☁️ When I'm away from the world of programming 💻, I like to spend my time with books 📖 (especially fantasy books 🪄, and even more especially those by [Brandon Sanderson](https://www.brandonsanderson.com), games 🎮, movies, series and and glorious synth music 🎵.
- 🧔🏻‍♂️ I'm a person with an [INTP](https://wiki.personality-database.com/books/jungian-derivatives/page/intp) personality, enthusiastic 😬, curious 🤨 (who loves to ask random questions) and who always has a strange interest or a crazy idea 🧐.
- 🤷🏻‍♂️ My favorite color is orange 🧡, and if I could choose magical powers, they would be Aerokinesis ☁️, Electrokinesis ⚡  and/or Magnetokinesis. I think that's a good summary of who I am. 😌
